"# GoTSQL" 

Can be placed on the web so you can connect to MS SQL servers online (as long as you can form the network connection!)

Bugs:
At the moment it can only pull string values
Will include type conversation so that if you pull INT/FLOAT etc instead of VARCHAR you will receive result.
At the moment if you query int columns you'll get '<int Value>' and so on.
