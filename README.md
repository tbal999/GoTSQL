"# GoTSQL" 

If you want to use this app download it, build it and use it on a PC for local SQL intranet.

You can connect to Microsoft SQL servers via this web app, and submit dyanmic SQL queries and get results with it.
You can also save any results to CSV file contained within 'outputsaves' folder which is generated within the folder the application is kept. 



The purpose of this tool is to show that you can use reflection to deserialize the results of SQL queries dynamically using Go, which we all know is a statically-typed language. It kiiind of works but there is an issue.
